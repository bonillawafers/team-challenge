> Marissa: Some help from Cameron 
Nick: Joel


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####

##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> Marissa: 6
Nick:7
Alex:8
Aisha:7


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Marissa: I wish we could have gone over some more complex tests in class.
Nick: Conflicts with verifying that forms are valid to make sure that the submit button wasn't disabled
Alex: Unclear on how to close issues if doing feature branch workflow.

> As stated above, we did feature-branch workflow, so we were not sure how to close issues with commit messages when those commits and pushes were done from our independant feature branches.
> We all did work, but the closing of the issues on github might look a little wonky, we apologize for that!
